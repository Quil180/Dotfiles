# somebar - dwl-like bar for dwm

This is extremely work in progress.

## Dependencies

* c++ compiler, meson, and ninja
* Qt 5 GUI
* libwayland
* wayland-scanner

    sudo apt install build-essential meson ninja qtbase5-dev libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 \
        libwayland-bin libwayland-client0 libwayland-cursor0 libwayland-dev

dwl must have the [wayland-ipc patch](https://gitlab.com/raphaelr/dwl/-/raw/master/patches/wayland-ipc.patch) applied,
since that's how the bar communicates with dwl.

## Configuration

src/config.hpp

## Building

    meson setup build
    ninja -C build

## Usage

somebar doesn't use dwl's status feature. You can start somebar using dwl's `-s` option,
but if you do, close stdout.
